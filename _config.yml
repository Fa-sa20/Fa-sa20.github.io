  I am Fatima Saad, a passionate and dedicated Computer Science student currently pursuing my Bachelor of Science degree at Michigan State University. With a strong foundation in programming languages such as Python and C++, I am eager to apply my skills in various projects and internships.

  Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a keen interest in security management, which is reflected in my minor. I am actively involved in community initiatives such as the Women In Engineering program, where I mentor fellow female engineering students, and the MSU Spartan Cyber Security team, where I contributed to designing a secure supply chain solution for medical devices.

  My professional experiences include working as a Clerical Assistant at the Office of Student Support and Accountability, where I honed my organizational and time management skills, and as the Head Cashier at Papaya Fruit Market, where I developed exceptional customer service abilities.

  I am fluent in both Arabic and English, which has allowed me to engage with diverse communities and foster inclusive environments. My goal is to leverage my technical and interpersonal skills to make a meaningful impact in the field of computer science.
